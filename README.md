# Docker Nodejs-jwt-Auth
This is my first attempt to create a docker image from a project. This is only to test creating and running docker images locally on macOS.

## To Get the Repo

```
git clone git@github.com:Rayzon3/docker-auth-typeGraphqlPostgres.git

npm install

npm run dev
```

##  To Build docker image
```
docker build -t {yourname}/{projectname}

```
